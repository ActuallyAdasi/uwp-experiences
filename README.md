# App Dev on Xbox


This is the App Dev on Xbox event and blog repository for demos and sample apps. Visit the [App Dev on Xbox landing page](http://aka.ms/xboxappdev) to watch the video recordings from the live event, read the blog posts, or just to check out all the resources. 

Each sample app lives on a seperate branch in this repository. As more sample apps are added, we will add more branches. This is the current list of sample apps:

- **Fourth Coffee** - a UWP news application [ [code](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/news/apps/News) | [blog](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/09/09/tailoring-your-app-for-xbox-and-the-tv-app-dev-on-xbox-series) ]
- **Atmosphere** - a UWP weather application built with Unity [ [code](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/Atmosphere/apps) | [blog](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/09/15/unity-interop-and-app-extensibility-app-dev-on-xbox-series) ]
