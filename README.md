[![AdventureWorks1](http://i.imgur.com/m5eUmaL.jpg)]()

Adventure Works is a photo capture UWP sample app that takes advantage of the built in UWP camera APIs for capturing and previewing the camera stream. Using Win2D, an open source library for 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration, the app can enhance any photo by appling rich effects or filters, and by using intelligent Cognitive Services API it can analyze any photos to auto tag and caption it appropriately, and more importantly, detect people and emotion.

## Setup

The Face, Emotion, and Computer Vision APIs require you to provide your own keys which you can [generate here](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions) for free. The app has been tested with the free version of the APIs.
