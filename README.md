Adventure Works is a cross device UWP application for sharing adventures and experiences with my fictional friends. V3 of Adventure Works adds to [V1](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/AdventureWorks_v1_camera_app) and [V2](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/AdventureWorks_v2_rome_maps_social) support for Ink on devices that support it, and support for speech interaction where it makes sense (including both synthesis and recognition). 
As a reminder, in the previous versions of the app we added the ability to:
* capture, edit, and store photos for a specific trip
* auto analyze images and tag friends using Cognitive Services vision APIs
* view albums from friends on an interactive map
* share albums on social networks like Facebook and Twitter
* Use one device to remote control slideshows running on another device using Project Rome
* and more

This is the final version of the sample app that includes everything before it.

## Setup
The app will build and run immediately. However, to get the full functionality of the app, the Keys.cs file will need to be populated with the appropriate API keys for each service. The app has been developed with the free version of each service, so you will not need to pay for any service to play with the app.

1. The LUIS service requires an App Id and an Azure subscription Id. 
    * To get an App Id, visit the [LUIS home page](https://www.luis.ai) and create a new app. Use the [LUIS\AdventureWorks.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/AdventureWorks_v3_speech_ink/Adventure%20Works/LUIS) file to import the Adventure Works utterances, intents and entities to the app. Go to App Settings to get the App Id.
    * To get a subscription key via Azure, you will need to sign in to the Microsoft Azure Portal and create a new Cognitive Service API. Choose the free tier of the LUIS API and click on Keys. Once you have created your key, you can add it to your account via the application settings dialog, found in any application.  Read the full instructions [here](https://www.luis.ai/Help#CreatingKeys)

2. The Face, Emotion, and Computer Vision APIs require you to provide your own keys which you can [generate here](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions) for free. 

3. The MapControl requires a MapServiceToken that can be generated by [following the instructions here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/authentication-key)

4. Facebook integration requires a FacebookAppId that can be generated by [following the instructions here](http://uwpcommunitytoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/services/Facebook/)

5. Twitter integration requires a *Twitter Consumer Key*, *Twitter Consumer Secret* and a *Callback Uri* that can be setup by [following the instructions here](http://uwpcommunitytoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/services/Twitter/)
