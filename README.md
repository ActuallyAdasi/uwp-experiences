Adventure Works is a cross device UWP application for sharing adventures and experiences with my fictional friends. V2 of Adventure Works adds to the [original app](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/AdventureWorks_v1_camera_app) the capabilities (1) to extend the experience to other devices that the user owns through the Project “Rome” APIs, (2) to be location aware using the powerful Maps API, and (3) to integrate with 3rd party social networks.
