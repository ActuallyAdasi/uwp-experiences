# The News Experience #

Hey there,

Thank you for checking out this sample app - we hope you find it as useful as we had fun making it. :)

Fourth Coffee is a UWP *showcase* app that works across the desktop, phone, and Xbox One and offers a premium experience that takes advantage of each deviceâ€™s strengths. This app features per device tailored UI with support for Gamepad, Focus and TV layout on the Xbox One. The app is only a sample which uses **fictional data**.

The source code is available for everyone on our [GitHub repository][news-source] - we encourage you to play with the app and the source code and use it in your app as needed.

Use the [blog post][news-blog-post] and [short One Dev Minute video][news-video] to learn even more about this showcase app.

There are more showcase apps on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/uwp-experiences) and [store account](#ms-windows-store://publisher/?name=Developer%20World), we hope you find them useful.

Thank you,

Developer World team
