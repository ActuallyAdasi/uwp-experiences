# The Spacecraft Explorer Showcase #

Hey there,

Thank you for checking out this sample app - we hope you find it as useful as we had fun making it. :)

Spacecraft Explorer is a Surface Dial showcase app that shows you how to implement a Surface Dial to any UWP app by:
- Using the Surface Dial as an input method to control the app
- Implementing custom menu items to navigate between the different app modes, instead of using the buttons
- Supporting a custom On-Screen menu that will be rendered below the Surface Dial when placed in screen.

The source code is available for everyone on our [GitHub repository][spacecraft-source] - we encourage you to play with the app and the source code and use it in your app as needed.

There are more showcase apps on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/uwp-experiences) and [store account](#ms-windows-store://publisher/?name=Developer%20World), we hope you find them useful.

Thank you,

Developer World team
