# The Weather Experience #

Hey there,

thank you for checking out this sample app - we hope you find it as useful as we had fun making it. :)

Atmosphere is a weather app that showcases the use of the popular Unity Engine to build beautiful UWP apps. In addition, the app implements UWP app extensions to enable other developers to extend certain areas of the app and it exposes an app service that enables other apps to use that weather information.

The source code is available for everyone on our [GitHub repository][source] - we encourage you to play with the app and the source code and use it in your app as needed.

Use the [blog post][blog-post] and [short One Dev Minute video][video] to learn even more about this showcase app.

There are more showcase apps on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/uwp-experiences) and [store account](#ms-windows-store://publisher/?name=Developer%20World), we hope you find them useful.

Thank you,

Developer World team
